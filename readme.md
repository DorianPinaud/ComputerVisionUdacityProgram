# Readme

This project keeps track on my progress on [the computer vision udacity nanodegree](https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd891/parts/cd1859/). Feel free to explore it !

## Setup

The script [setup-env.bat](.\setup-env.bat) create the conda virtual environment and install the dependencies. If it is already created and installed, the script just activate the conda virtual environment.
